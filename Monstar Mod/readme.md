## Skills Added
### Lemurian Skills:
#### Primary Variants:
- Elder's Authority
  - a.k.a Elder Lumerian Fireball
  - Fire 5 fireballs instead of 1
  - Taken directly from the Elder Lumerian
#### Secondary Variants:
- Elder's Whisper
  - a.k.a. Elder Lumerian Fire-Breath
  - Breathe fire and burn enemies
  - Also taken from the EL
  - Was originally a Primary SKill variant, but this led to situations where the Lemurian can't hit anything
    - *cough cough Vagrant*
- Soldier Tackle (name WIP)
  - Taken from the Unused Paladin character
    - Known as [paladinbodyleap] internally
  - Charge a short distance, then stun & knockback anything you hit
  - Also a decent way to move just a little faster
    - Can be used while sprinting!
  - I may remove it from the Lemurian since it fits better with the Clay Templar.
    - Then again, it's a helluva lot of fun since the Lemurian is just a helmet away from being a football player
    
<br>
 
### Imp Skills:
#### Utility Variants:
- Last Surprise
  - Turn invisible for about 5ish seconds. Stuns enemies on activation and on attacking out of it
  - Taken from the Unused Bandit character
    - Known as [banditbodycloak] internally
  - Lowered the cooldown so that the Imp has more of an edge in battle
- Providence's Escape (Rapture?) {name WIP}
  - Teleports the player to a fixed location on the map, usually very high in the sky
  - Taken from the Imp Boss 
  - It is actually broken, but at the same time it adds a bit of strategy to the Imp's Playstyle
    - Teleport to a safe, fixed location at the expense of possible fall damage due to the height of the location.


<br>

### Clay Templar Skills:
#### Primary Variants:
- Terravolley
  - Taken from the Dunestrider Boss, it fires jars filled with tar at foes.
  - Fires 5 - 11 jars depending on how long you hold the button for
  - Auto-travels to where the cursor is at the time of firing
    - This means that it can go clear across the map if aimed properly
#### Secondary Variants:
- Soldier Bash (name WIP)
  - Taken from the Unused Paladin character
  - Charge a short distance, then stun & knockback anything you hit
  - Also a decent way to move just a little faster
    - Can be used while sprinting!
- Clay Bowl (Name WIP)
  - Also taken from the Dunestrider boss
  - Fires ~3-4 giant balls of tar that follow the terrain
  - Also has the added bonus of homing in on nearby creatures
  - Can't do jack against airborne targets

<br>

### Alloy Vulture Skills:
#### Primary Variants:
- ROBOBALL_BOSS_BALLS

<br>

### Drone Skills
#### Primary Variants:
- STOCK: Standard S.A. Gun
  - 4-shot burst. Rather weak on its own.
- UPGRADE: Overclocked Gun
  - Just a beefed-up version of the base skill
     - A tad overpowered by the time you get to area 3/4
  - Taken from the Backup/Strike Drone
- EXPERIMENTAL: Homing Missile Barrage
  - Should be a good weapon, but it actually has a fatal flaw:
    - Rockets will ALWAYS home in on the nearest target
  - I may replace this with the Paladin's rocket in the future
    - Make it more like a rocket launcher instead of a Lazy-EZ-Gun

<br>

### Walker-Turret Skills
#### Primary Variants:
- Gauss Cannon
  - Effectively the same as the base turret's gun, but now it's mobile!
- Gatling Gun (name WIP)
  - Take the stationary Gun Turrets, and give 'em legs
  - Has a unique fuction taken directly from the skilldef sheet
  - I may make this function more like the Airboat Gun from Half-Life 2 in a future update
