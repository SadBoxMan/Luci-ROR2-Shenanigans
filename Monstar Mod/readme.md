- Soldier Bash
  - Taken from the Unused Paladin character
  - Charge a short distance, then stun & knockback anything you hit
  - Also a decent way to move just a little faster
    - Can be used while sprinting!
  - I may remove it from the Lemurian since it fits better with the Clay Templar.
    - Then again, it's a helluva lot of fun since the Lemurian is just a helmet away from being a football player
